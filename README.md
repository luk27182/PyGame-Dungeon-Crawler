# Pygame Dungeon Crawler

## Required Packages
This game is entirely written in python. I am using python 3.10.9 and things work well. Also make sure you have the following packages installed:
- pygame 
- random (is probably already installed by default)
- sys (is probably already installed by default)

To run the program, just get to the directory which contains main.py and run
> python main.py

The program should boot up as a new window.
